Coral
=====

This repository contains the complete code base for Coral, a parallel text
alignment tool.

Coral is a desktop application developed in Java, used to either manually or
automatically align a parallel text, i.e. to find correspondences of segments
in two translations of a text. Usually, one text is the original, and the other
a translation to another language.

Manual alignment is supported with an easy-to-use graphical interface, allowing
the user to use drag-and-drop actions to create N to N connections between
segments in both texts. Texts can also be aligned automatically using the
language-agnostic Gale & Church alignment algorithm.
Aligned texts can be exported to the XML-based TMX format.

Coral was developed by a student team as a practical project for a course at
the University of Zagreb, Croatia, but potential contributors are welcome to
use the code and help expand Coral by implementing new features.
